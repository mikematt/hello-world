# hello-world

This text is from the MASTER BRANCH.
## **ADDED THIS IN MY LOCAL3 CLONE**
My first repository-matic.
Okay, can't use &lt;span&gt; tag.


Here's my foist attempt at *Markdown* **markup**. Need to look up more of the syntax.

## Let's try a bulleted list:
- Bullitt
- Bullets Over Broadway
- Number one with a bullet
- Bullet, ballot, billet, bollet
- Benny the bullet-head

How do I put in special characters, or reserved characters, like an asterisk or pound sign? Need to look that up.

Maybe I can use HTML ampersand escapes: &amp; &quot; &mdash;
